## How to Get All Exchange Symbols Using the Script

This Python script retrieves information about all cryptocurrency exchanges identified by [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en). It saves the data as a CSV file and returns it as a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

### Features
- **Error Handling**: Handles API and file-related errors gracefully.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatically retries API requests in case of network or server issues.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Allows customization of the output folder and file-saving behavior.
- **Logging**: Logs key events and errors to a log file and console for better debugging.
- **Progress Bar**: Enables progress tracking during data processing.
- **Config File**: Supports external configuration for settings like the API base URL.

### How It Works

1. **API Request**: 
   The script uses the `requests` library to query the CoinGecko `/exchanges/list` endpoint. A retry mechanism ensures resilience to network interruptions.

   ```python
   session = requests_retry_session()
   response = session.get(base_url + "exchanges/list")
   response.raise_for_status()
   ```

2. **Data Transformation**: 
   The API response is validated and transformed into a pandas DataFrame, which organizes the data into a tabular format.

   ```python
   df_exchange_symbols = pd.DataFrame(exchange_data)
   df_exchange_symbols.index.name = "index"
   ```

3. **Saving Data**: 
   The script saves the processed data as a CSV file in a specified output directory, using a filename that includes the current date.

   ```python
   csv_filename = f"AllExchanges_CoinGecko_{current_date()}.csv"
   df_exchange_symbols.to_csv(os.path.join(output_folder, csv_filename), index=False)
   ```

4. **Logging**: 
   Logs provide details of the script's operation and any encountered issues. Logs are saved in a file (`app.log`) and displayed in the console.

### Directory Structure

The following directory structure is recommended for running the script:

```
project_folder/
â”œâ”€â”€ config.json
â”œâ”€â”€ Output/  # Automatically created if missing
â”œâ”€â”€ app.log
â”œâ”€â”€ script.py
```

---

### Example `config.json`

The script reads configuration settings such as the API base URL from a `config.json` file. Below is an example:

```json
{
    "base_url": "https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/"
}
```

If the file is missing, default settings are used.

---

### Installation and Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries before running the script:

```bash
pip install requests pandas tqdm
```

---

### Running the Script

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the script's directory.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

---

### Output

The script creates a CSV file in the output folder (default: `Output`) with the following naming convention:

`AllExchanges_CoinGecko_YYYYMMDD.csv`

The CSV file contains:
- Exchange ID
- Exchange Name
- Additional metadata provided by CoinGecko.

### Features in Detail

- **Error Handling**: Catches errors related to API requests or file saving, ensuring robust operation.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatically retries API requests for a configurable number of attempts to handle transient failures.
- **Logging**: Logs key actions, including the creation of output directories, successful API calls, and file-saving operations.
- **Progress Bar**: Utilizes `tqdm` for progress tracking during data processing.
- **Customizable Output**: Allows you to specify the output folder or disable file-saving entirely, making the function flexible for different use cases.

---

### Notes

- Ensure your system has internet access to retrieve data from the CoinGecko API.
- If no custom output folder is provided, the script uses a default folder named `Output`.

This script is an efficient way to retrieve and save exchange data for cryptocurrency analysis or integration into broader projects. ðŸš€
